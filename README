React Hooks
(Normal JS utility functions)

-useState() - Superpowerful State Variables in react
whenever state variables update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)
-useEffect()- if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect called on every Initial render(just once).
if dependency array is [btnNamereact] => called everytime btnnamereact is updated.
